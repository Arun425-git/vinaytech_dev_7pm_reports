Real time examples:

a) Send en email, load data, after successful load send again an email, load data to cube database, send an email

b) You want to receive a mobile message as soon as you got an Important Indication email from my manager




Examples:

a) Send an email instantly [manual trigger]









Power Apps:

A low code approach to create mobile apps and web based solutions.

Real-Time Scenario:

Delivery manager need a form in the app where he wants to see three buttons. 
When he clicks first button, respective report should sent to customer team.
When he clicks second button, respecive report should sent to sales managers.
When he clicks third button, respecive report should sent to subordinates.

Solution:

We need .net / java / phython / html / php etc. languages code [ huge code approach].
Without this code we can create simple forms with actions using Power Apps [Low-Code approach].



Design Reason:

Now everyone can quickly build and share low-code apps with Microsoft Power Apps.

Ex: 
	Your customer wants to enter data and report should show the same data?
	Solution:
	Create a mobile app [with simple form with set of text boxes and buttons], after entering details, when user clicks
	Submit, the data will be loaded to the database and report displayed with that data.
	
	Your customer need a form to enter data and below the form actual report.
	Solution:
	Create an app with two sections  
	a) Form section
	b) Report Display section [ Embed your Power BI Report]

Excercise today:
=======================================================================================
Example 1:

Sending an email to gmail using "Power Apps to Gmail "  in Power Automate [Microsoft Flow].
=======================================================================================

Example 2:

Click Power Apps button to send an email using "Gmail".  [Microsoft Flow]

=======================================================================================

Example 3:

Create an APP which shows Power BI report

Embedding Power BI Report in PowerApps Canvas [in a tile]

Practice:

1. Install Power APPs mobile app from play store
2. Connect using your credentials 
3. You will be able to see all the apps shared with you
4. You can now work on it


========================================================================================
Example 4:

Entering Details in a form and verifying the changes at source

Practice:
a) Add one file at OneDrive [ if you use it, no Gateway connection required, if On-Premises sources used {SQL Server, C / D Drives} then 
    Gateway connection is required.

b) Create an app form from one drive file

c) Do the changes fo formation (colors, fonts, titles, etc...) and styles, and Save it.

	a) Browser View
		See the options and change
	b) Detail view
		See the options and change
	c) Data View
		See the options and change

d) Go to preview, add rows, so that those rows will be visible at actual source at OneDrive.

e) Connect to Power APPs in the mobile, add rows / modify rows, those changes you will find in OneDrive file.

=======================================================================================


Example 5:
Create a Power BI Report from a data source, providing user an interface to enter / modify data, so that it will reflect in the source and
report level.


Power APP[ change data]---> OneDrive [Excel]---> Power BI Report in the Power BI Service refresh


b) Create a Power BI Report from the OneDrive Excel. This report will be refreshed when Power APPs level data changing.
a) Follow the above approach to take changes


Note:  You can Install a Gatewateway [Data Gateway], connect to On-Premise source and bring chanages to Power BI report from Mobile APP changes.
